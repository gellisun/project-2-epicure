# Project 2 - Epicure

## Description

<p>This is my second solo project on the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive. Unit 2 was all about learning to build a full-stack application with Node/Express/MongoDB from the ground up.</p>

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Express, Node.JS
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Git, GitHub 

## Brief

### The requirement was do deliver a working full-stack app that meets or exceeds these technical requirements:
-  Have at least 2 data entities in addition to the User Model - one entity that represents the main functional idea for the app and another with a One:Many or Many:Many relationship with that main entity (embedded or referenced)
- Use OAuth authentication.
- Implement basic authorization that restricts access to features that need a logged in user in order to work by "protecting" those routes from anonymous users using the ensureLoggedIn middleware. In addition, ensure that editing and deletion of a data resource can only be done by the user that created that data.
- Have full-CRUD data operations somewhere within the app's features.
- Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - consistent and polished user interface.
- Be deployed online (Heroku).
- A README.md file

## Planning

<p> My app had to be a platform where, as a user I could pin all in one place everything related to food: restaurants I have been to and that I would like to go back to o recommend if asked, recipes I created myself or that I found and tried etcâ€¦ Ideally I would have wanted it to be a social platform where to follow people and favourite their posts based on personal likings.<br>
The ERD is the overall idea I had during planning of the data that would be stored in the database.</p>

<p>Trello is the tool I used to manage every step of the project</p>

<p>As it is shown in the wireframe, the idea was to make the app responsive so I tried my best to achieve that.<br>
I planned to have a login page, a page that would display all posts and different pages that, as a user, I could go to if I wanted:</p>
- to add delete or edit a post
- to add delete or edit a comment
